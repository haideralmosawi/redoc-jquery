Web development is based on three languages:

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): Used to annotate page content and indicating where the headers, paragraphs, links, etc. are in the file
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to define what page elements will look like
- Javascript: Used to define how page elements will behave 

jQuery is a Javascript library that simplifies writing Javascript code.

(**_Give an example of the difference between Javascript and jQuery to highlight the benefit of jQuery_**)

Web development is based on three primary languages:

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): Used to annotate page content and indicate where the headers, paragraphs, links, etc. are in the file
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to define what page elements will look like
- Javascript: Used to define how page elements will behave 

jQuery is a free, open-source Javascript library that simplifies writing Javascript code, allowing experienced developers to write code faster, and novice developers to include advanced Javascript effects, without deep knowledge of the language. 

## Benefits of Using jQuery

One of the main concerns web developers have is ensuring that the websites or applications they develop look and work well in a variety of web browsers (such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Opera, etc). jQuery functions are developed with cross-browser compatibility in mind.

(**_Give an example of the difference between Javascript and jQuery to highlight the benefit of jQuery_**)
[Example of jQuery's benefit over pure Javascript](http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-javascipt-designers/)

Since jQuery is written in Javascript, it helps to have a basic understanding of the Javascript language. If you're still not familiar with Javascript, check out this [Javascript basics tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).

_(Include an overview of what's covered in the documentation. Explain how other components of jQuery, such as UI and Mobile, are incorporated into jQuery Core, and what their benefits are)_

_(What benefits of jQuery should I include? Free, open-source, cross-browser compatibility, ease of use, most popular, community, plugins, ???)_

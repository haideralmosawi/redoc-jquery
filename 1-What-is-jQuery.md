Web development is based on three primary languages:

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language): Used to annotate page content and indicate where the headers, paragraphs, links, etc. are in the file
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to define what page elements will look like
- Javascript: Used to define how page elements will behave 

jQuery is a free, open-source Javascript library that simplifies writing Javascript code, allowing experienced developers to write code faster, and novice developers to include advanced Javascript effects, without deep knowledge of the language. 

One of the main concerns web developers have is ensuring that the websites or applications they develop look and work well in a variety of web browsers (such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Opera, etc). jQuery functions are developed with cross-browser compatibility in mind.

(**_Give an example of the difference between Javascript and jQuery to highlight the benefit of jQuery_**)
[Example of jQuery's benefit over pure Javascript](http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-javascipt-designers/)

Since jQuery is written in Javascript, it helps to have a basic understanding of the Javascript language. If you're still not familiar with Javascript, check out this [Javascript basics tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).

_(Include an overview of what's covered in the documentation. Explain how other components of jQuery, such as UI and Mobile, are incorporated into jQuery Core, and what their benefits are)_

# redoc-jquery: Re-Documenting jQuery
My attempt at rewriting jQuery's documentation, while going through it as a n00b.

I hope to contribute this project to the jQuery Foundation Documentation project.

- [jQuery's Documentation Github page](https://github.com/jquery)
- [Contribution page](http://contribute.jquery.org/documentation/)
- [jQuery's Documentation](http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/)

## Problems with the current documentation

- The "Learn" documentation is separate from the jQuery site, which can be confusing
- The documentation doesn't begin by explaining what jQuery is or what it's used for
- There are no broad principles used to explain jQuery
- There is no explanation of how the different components of jQuery come together
- There is no distinction between jQuery code and standard Javascript code (beginners are unable to make such a distinction)
- It's not complete beginner (a.k.a. n00b) friendly. You still need to know about Javascript and web development basics. I want the documentation to be accessible to complete beginners. Even if it's just to say: "To use jQuery, you need to know how to use HTML and Javascript" or give a code block and say: "To understand this code, you need to be familiar with HTML5. Read more about it here: link"
- The documentation doesn't walk the reader through the process of using jQuery in an actual project
	- jQuery is X, used for Y
	- To add jQuery to your project, you do A
	- Test out that jQuery is properly installed by doing B
	- Troubleshooting: If you don't see this, then the potential problems are C, D, and E
- Subtopics don't appear in the sidebar (e.g. How jQuery Works under About jQuery). For the Introduction - at least - the subtopics of What is it? And why use it? Are crucial to feeling acquainted with jQuery
- The docs touch on the web development landscape, but a beginner can still be very confused about everything involved in web development, and how the pieces come together (I have to check if the Mozilla Developer Network does a good job of this, and the jQuery docs can reference that at the beginning. Also, diagrams would help)

In this project I will actively identify the problems with the current jQuery documentation at learn.jquery.com, while rewriting it to make it more accessible in the hope that others, like me, will find it easier to understand jQuery and start using it quickly.

I believe good documentation requires:

- An explanation of the underlying theory behind the technology
- Reference material to make using the technology easy

Therefore, good jQuery documentation needs to explain what jQuery is, basic syntax principles, features of the library, and then reference material on how to make the desired effects.

While writing out this documentation I will explicitly write out my apprehensions, which I will iron out as the project develops. But it's important for me to do this to ensure clarity of thought and that problems are dealt with.

## My Goal

I want to make it easier for absolute beginners to be able to navigate web dev resources without getting stuck, and to be able to create websites and applications as soon as possible (ideally, while they're learning to code). 

I feel like I'm drifting into passive reading as opposed to active learning (read + code). How can I overcome this? And how can the documentation encourage immediate coding.
